GTest-based Unit Tests

This directory contains GTest-based unit tests for NSS.

Currently, these are only loopback-type tests of libsssl,
but could be expanded to other types of tests. To make these
work do:

- In gtest/gtest do:
  svn co https://googletest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk gtest

- Make a certdb without a PIN somewhere, e.g., data/. This
  needs to have a trust anchor and a key named "server".

At that point you should be able to run the unit tests as:

  ssl_unittests -d ROOT/gtests/data

Modulo the usual NSS shared library path issues.

There is a very trivial set of tests that demonstrate some
of the features.


TODO LIST (PRE NSS LANDING)
1. Fix the Makefile setup so it's clean as opposed to hacked
   up. This includes:

   * Fixing up my weird rules.mk hacks.
   * Making gtest conditionally compile or auto-download.

2. Make a reasonable sample cert DB.

3. Go over the code and clean things up.

4. Get code reviewed.


TODO LIST (POST NSS LANDING)
1. Get integrated into NSS CI.

2. Add support for DTLS

3. Expanded TLS happy-path tests. Starting list:
   - Version negotiation
   - Cipher suite negotiation
   - All the extensions.

4. DTLS network stability cases
   - Packet loss
   - Reordering
   - MTU throttling

5. Sad path cases.
